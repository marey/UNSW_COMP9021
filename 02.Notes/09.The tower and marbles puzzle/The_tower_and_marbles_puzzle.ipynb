    "In order to test the quality of the products of a marble manufacturer, one plans to drop marbles from various levels of a tower and see whether they break. We make the following assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If a marble breaks when dropped from a given level, then it would have broken if dropped from a higher level.\n",
    "* All marbles are of the same quality: they all break or all do not break if dropped from a given level.\n",
    "\n",
    "One intends to find out the highest level $L$ such that a marble dropped from level $L$ does not break, but breaks if dropped from a higher level, if any. The aim is to minimise the effort, that is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* find out the maximum number of drops $d$ needed in the worst case to get the correct answer;\n",
    "* come up with a strategy to, for any marble quality, get the correct answer with no more than $d$ drops.\n",

    "* the number of levels, $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both $m$ and $n$ are assumed to be nonnegative integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is straightforward if $m$ is equal to 1. Then $d$ is equal to $n$ and the only valid strategy consists in dropping the unique marble from level 1, then from level 2, then from level 3... until it breaks, if it ever does. The maximum of $n$ drops is needed if the marbles are of the best quality and do not break when dropped from any level, or if they are of the next best quality and break when dropped from the highest level, but not from any level below.\n",
    "\n",
    "There exists a general solution for any value of $m$, but a simpler solution exists in case $m$ is equal to 2; before describing and implementing the former, we describe and implement the latter. So for now, we set the value of $m$ to 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than directly computing $d$ from $n$, we reverse the problem: given $d$, what is the maximum number of levels $n$ (the maximum height of the tower) such that for any marble quality, one is sure to correctly assess the marbles' quality with no more than $d$ drops? If the first marble ever breaks, dropped from level $L$, one is left with the second marble only and has no other option but explore all levels below $L$, if any, starting with the lowest such level, and making one's way up on all unexplored levels below $L$.\n",
    "\n",
    "*  This means that the first drop should be from level $d$: if the marble breaks, then there are $d-1$ drops left and the second marble has to be dropped from level 1, then from level 2... potentially up to level $d-1$ (in case the lowest level from which marbles break is either level $d$ or level $d-1$). It is best to make the first drop from as high as possible, so the first drop should be made from level $d$.\n",
    "* The same reasoning shows that in case the first marble does not break following the first drop, it should then be dropped from level $d+(d-1)$: if it breaks, then there are $d-2$ drops left and there are $d-2$ unexplored levels between level $d$, the highest level $L$ for which it is known that a marble dropped from $L$ does not break, and level $d+(d-1)$, the lowest level $L'$ for which it is known that a marble dropped from $L'$ does break. The second marble should be dropped from level $d+1$, then from level $d+2$... potentially up to level $2d-2$ (in case the lowest level from which marbles break is either level $2d-1$ or level $2d-2$).\n",

In the original problem, $n$ is known and arbitrary, while $d$ has to be computed from $n$. We infer from the previous considerations that $d$ is the smallest nonnegative integer such that $d^2+d-2n\\geq 0$, hence $d=\\lceil\\frac{-1+\\sqrt{1+8n}}{2}\\rceil$.\n",

We should also allow for the case where the marble is of best quality and does not break when dropped from any level. To simplify the design of the solution, it is best to let $n+1$ be the corresponding value. One can think of $n+1$ to be an additional, \"virtual\" level, such that any marble dropped from that level is sure to break, which is consistent with the reasonable assumption that a marble is sure to break when dropped from high enough.\n",

The initialisation should capture what we know before the procedure starts: `low` should be set to `0` and `high` to $n+1$. At any stage of the computation, `low` will be smaller than `high`.\n",
