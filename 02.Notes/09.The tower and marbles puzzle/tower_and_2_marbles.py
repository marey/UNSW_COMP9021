'''
Solves the tower and 2 glass marbles problem. The user is prompted to
enter a number n of levels of a tower. Using 2 marbles, one has to
discover the highest level, if any, such that dropping a marble from
that level makes it break, using a strategy that minimises the number of
drops in the worst case (it is assumed that any marble would break when
dropped from a level where one marble breaks, and also when dropped from
any higher level; the marbles might not break when dropped from any
level).

The idea is to ask: what is the maximum height h of a tower such that an
answer can always be found with no more than d drops? It is easy to
verify that h is the largest integer such that
d + (d - 1) + (d - 2) + ... + 2 + 1 >= h, and that the strategy consists
in dropping the first glass from level d, then from level d + (d - 1),
then from level d + (d - 1) + (d - 2), ..., until the marble breaks, if
that ever happens. In case that happens and i is the least integer such
that the glass breaks when dropped from level
d + ... + (d - i - 1) + (d - i), then one drops the second glass from
level d + ... + (d - i - 1) + 1, and then from level
d + ... + (d - i - 1) + 2, etc., until the glass breaks, if that ever
hapens.
