Solves the tower and m glass marbles problem. The user is prompted to
enter a number n of levels of a tower and a number m of marbles. Using
those m marbles, one has to discover the highest level, if any, such
that dropping a marble from that level makes it break, using a strategy
that minimises the number of drops in the worst case (it is assumed that
any marble would break when dropped from a level where one marble
breaks, and also when dropped from any higher level; the marbles might
not break when dropped from any level).

The idea is to ask: what is the maximum height of a tower such that an
answer can always be found with no more than d drops? Let H(d, m)
denote that maximum height.
- If the marble breaks, m - 1 marbles remain and there is no need to
  test higher levels.
- If the marble does not break, m marbles remain and there is no need
  to test lower levels.
- In any case, d - 1 drops remain.
This yields: H(d, m) = H(d - 1, m - 1) + H(d - 1, m) + 1.
The base cases are when either d = 0 or m = 0, in which case
H(d, m) = 0. This allows one to compute d as the least integer with
H(d, m) >= n. For the simulation, if low is the highest level from which
it is known that a marble can be dropped without breaking, d' is the
number of drops that remain, and m' is the number of marbles that
remain, then the next marble should be dropped from level
low + H(d' - 1, m' - 1) + 1.

Set B(0, k) = 1 for all k, B(n, 0) = 1 for all n, and
B(n + 1, k + 1) = B(n, k) + B(n, k + 1).
The recurrence relation is identical to the one that determines the
binomial coefficients. It is easy to verify that:
- H(n, k) is equal to B(n, k) - 1;
- if k > n then B(n, k) is equal to B(n, n);
- if k <= n then B(n, k) is equal to the sum of n choose k1
  where k1 ranges over {0, ..., k}.
The values B(n, k) determine the Bernouilli rectangle, whose rows are
computed similarly to the rows of Pascal triangle. The program makes
direct use of B(., .), and indirect use of H(., .):
