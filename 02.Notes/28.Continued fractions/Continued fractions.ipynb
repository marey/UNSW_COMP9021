    "Let `cf` denote an object of type `ContinuedFraction` that represents $r$. In case $r$ is rational then it suffices to call `to_fraction()` on `cf` to get a `Fraction` object and then call `approximate_as_decimals()` on the latter. Now suppose that $r$ is not rational, hence the decimal representation of $r$ is infinite. Its integral part is `cf.finite_expansion[0]` if $r$ is positive and `cf.finite_expansion[0] + 1` otherwise (see [Section 4](#negating-continued-fractions)). Let `fractions` denote `approximate_as_fractions()`, which returns a sequence of fractions $(F_0, F_1, F_2\\dots)$. It follows from (\\ref{eq_4}) and the observations that follow that the members of this sequence alternate between an approximation of $r$ from below and an approximation of $r$ from above, and that every second member offers a closer and closer approximation to $r$: one of $(F_0,F_2,F_4\\dots)$ and $(F_1,F_3,F_5\\dots)$ offers closer and closer approximations of $r$ from below, while the other offers closer and closer approximations of $r$ from above. Hence for all $i,p\\in\\mathbf N\\setminus\\{0\\}$, if $F_i$ and $F_{i+1}$ agree on the first $p$ decimal digits after the comma of their decimal expansions, then those $p$ digits are the first $p$ decimal digits after the comma of $r$'s decimal expansion. (Note that $F_0$ is an integer, $F_1$ might be an integer (then necessarily equal to $F_0+1$), and $F_2$, $F_3$... are not integers. This is why it is necessary to ignore $F_0$ and start with $i=1$.) So given $p\\in\\mathbf N\\setminus\\{0\\}$, in order to compute the first $p$ digits after the comma of the decimal expansion of $r$, it suffices to find $i\\in\\mathbf N\\setminus\\{0\\}$ such that $F_i$ and $F_{i+1}$ agree on the first $p$ decimal digits after the comma of their decimal expansions (which will then be the first $p$ decimal digits after the comma of their decimal expansion of $F_j$ for all $j>i$). These observations lead to the following adaptation of `Fraction`'s `approximate_as_decimals()` method of `ContinuedFraction`'s `approximate_as_decimals()` method:"
