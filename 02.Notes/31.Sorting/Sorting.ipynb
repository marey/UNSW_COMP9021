Let $i<h$ be given, and consider the round of comparisons that Insertion sort has to perform on the elements of the list at index $i$, $i+h$, $i+2h$, ..., $i+kh$ for some $k>1$, having performed all rounds of comparisons on the elements of list at index $i$, $i+h$, $i+2h$, ..., $i+k'$ successively for $k'$ equal to 1, then 2,... and finally $k-1$. So the elements of the list at index $i+kh$ and $i+(k-1)h$ are compared and swapped if needed. Suppose they are swapped. We have to verify the claim that the element of the list at index $i+(k-2)h$ is necessarily smaller than the element of the list at index $i+kh$ before the swap, hence there is no need to compare them and the round can stop.

    "To understand Heap sort, it is necessary to map lists to _complete binary trees_: read the values of the list from left to right and let them make up the values of the nodes of a binary tree, read from top to bottom and on a given level read from left to right, filling the tree so that all levels except possibly the last one are full, and having all nodes on the last level as much to the left as possible. For instance, take $[1, 10, 3, 7, 6, 2, 4, 9, 8, 5]$ as an example for $L$. It is mapped to the tree on the left below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div><img src=\"Illustrations/heap_sort_1.pdf\" width=\"600\"/></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The tree on the right has the same structure, that of all complete binary trees with 10 nodes, but it is moreover _heap ordered_, because the value of any inner node is at least equal to the value of its unique child or its two children: $10\\geq\\min(10,9)$, $9\\geq\\min(8,6)$, $4\\geq\\min(2,3)$, $8\\geq\\min(7,1)$, and $6\\geq 5$. Heap sort will first _heapify_ the tree that the list to sort has been mapped to, that is, move the values around so that the tree becomes heap ordered. Heapifying the tree on the left above will precisely change it to the tree on the right above. Hence for our example, Heap sort will first change $L$ to $[10,9,4,8,6,2,3,7,1,5]$. This will be done using the technique of _bubbling down_ in a tree the value of a node of the tree. This technique will be used again in the second part of the algorithm. Let us first describe the technique of bubbling down the value at the root $R$ of a tree $T$ (for the value of any other node, the technique just operates on the subtree rooted at that node). Bubbling down in $T$ the value $x$ at $R$ is performed recursively as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If $T$ has no other node but $R$, or if $x$ is greater than or equal to the value of any child of $R$, then nothing is done.\n",
    "* Otherwise, there are two cases.\n",
    "    * $R$ has a unique child $R'$.\n",
    "    * $R$ has two children, a left child $R_1$ and a right child $R_2$. Let $R$ be the child with the largest value, or in case both values are equal, arbitrarily let $R'$ be $R_1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In any case, let $R$ and $R'$ swap their values, so $x$ becomes the value of the root of $R'$. Bubble $x$ down in the tree rooted at $R'$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is immediately verified by induction that whether $R$ has a unique child that is the root of a heap ordered binary tree, or $R$ has two children each of which is the root of a heap ordered binary tree, bubbling $x$ down in $T$ makes $T$ itself heap ordered. It follows that a tree can be made heap ordered by bubbling down the values of all of its node, proceeding from the rightmost lowest node to the root (processing the nodes in reverse order of the standard enumeration previously described). The first nodes to process are the leaves, for which there is obviously nothing to do, so the bubbling down can actually start at the rightmost, leftmost inner node, which for our example of the tree $T$ that the list $[10,9,4,8,6,2,3,7,1,5]$ is mapped to, is the node with the value 6. This node has only one child, whose value is 5, so the subtree rooted at that node is heap ordered. The next node to process is the node whose value is 7, that is bubbled down as illustrated below, changing $T$ to the tree depicted on the right.\n",

    "<div><img src=\"Illustrations/heap_sort_3.pdf\" width=\"600\"/></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The subtree rooted at the node whose value is 10 is heap-ordered already, so to be done with the first stage of the algorithm, it remains to bubble 1 down. Observe that bubbling down an element determines a path, here (1, 10, 9, 8), that starts with the node under consideration and that goes down the tree, always chosing the largest value when having to go down either left or right, and stopping when reaching either a leaf or a node that has no child with a value that is stricly larger than the value being bubbled down. The effect is to bring the value being bubbled down to the end of the path, and to lift all other values along the path one level up.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div><img src=\"Illustrations/heap_sort_4.pdf\" width=\"600\"/></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage, $T$ has been heapified and $L$ has been correspondingly changed to $[10,9,4,8,6,2,3,7,1,5]$. Observe that $L$'s largest value, namely 10, is now the list's first element, or equivalently, is at the root of the tree. Having to become the list's last element, it can be put in place by swapping the list's first and last elements. Using the tree representation, the effect of the swap is shown in red for 5 and green for 10, which is now in place, in the tree on the left below. At this point, we have to consider that 10 is no longer part of the (active part of the) list and the (active part of the) tree any more, do as if  the list had been truncated of its last element, do as if the tree had been truncated of its last node. The 9-node tree is no longer heap ordered, but its proper subtrees are, so to heapify the tree it suffices to bubble 5 down, as determined by the path represented by the nodes in bright and light red. This results in the tree on the right below.\n",

    "The procedure is repeated to swap the value at the root of the tree, namely 9, then 8, then 7, with the value at the last node of the (active part of the) tree whose size changes from 9 to 8, then 7, then 6 as it \"loses\" the nodes with the values that have been put in place:\n",

The last step of the procedure that has been described compares $u_{2i+2}$ and $v_{2i+1}$ and puts the smallest of the two in place. Without loss of generality, suppose it is $u_{2i+2}$  and assume for a contradiction that $v_{2i+1}$ is not the next smallest value, so $i<\\frac{N}{2}-2$ and $u_{2i+3}$ is the next smallest value. If $u_{2i+2}$ and $u_{2i+3}$ both come from $H_1$ or both come from $H_2$, then there is some value in-between which belongs to $C_2$, hence has to be one of $v_{2i+1}$, ..., $v_{\\frac{N}{2}-1}$, which is impossible. Hence $u_{2i+2}$ has to be the penultimate element from $H_1$, namely $x_{\\frac{N}{2}-1}$, and $u_{2i+3}$ has to be the first element from $H_2$, namely $y_1$, or the other way around.

    "Eight algorithms have been described, implemented, simulated and analysed; all are based on comparing pairs of values. For each comparison, the result, True or False, lets the algorithm deterministically take one of two paths. That makes it possible to map any algorithm of this kind to a decision tree. To make the point more easily, take $N=3$, and write the list $L$ to sort as $[x_1,x_2,x_3]$. An algorithm designed to sort $L$ based on comparing pairs of values can be mapped to a tree $T$ each of whose inner nodes is labelled with a test of the form $x_i<x_j$, $i,j\\in\\{1,2,3\\}$, with a left branch to follow in case the test evaluables to True, and a right branch to follow in case the test evaluates to False. Leaves are labelled with a conclusion, in the form of a permutation of $(x_1,x_2,x_3)$, showing what $L$ eventually becomes thanks to swaps determined by the results of the tests that label the nodes of the path from the root to the leaf. The tree below is what both Bubble sort and Insertion sort map to. The first test performed by both algorithms is whether $x_1<x_2$.\n",

Since there are $N!$ permutations of $N$ elements, $T$ must have at least $N!$ leaves.
