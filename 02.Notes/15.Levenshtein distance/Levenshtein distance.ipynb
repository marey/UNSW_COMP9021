    "When typing a sequence of letters $w$ that is not recognised as a syntactically correct word, corrections can be suggested in the form of one or more syntactically correct words $w'$ \"close enough\" to $w$, that is, such that $w$ can be converted into $w'$ at a \"minimal cost\". The notion of _Levenshtein distance_ offers a possible formalisation.\n",
    "One can convert a word $w_1$ into a word $w_2$ by successive applications of two transformations: *deletion* of an occurrence of a character and *insertion* of an occurrence of a character. For instance, one can convert DEPART into LEOPARD thanks to 2 deletions and 3 insertions, which can be achieved in many different ways, three of which are:\n",

    "* DEPART -> EPART -> LEPART -> LEPAR -> LEPARD -> LEOPARD\n",
    "\n",
    "Associate a cost to each of both transformations. Denote the cost of a deletion by $C_\\delta$ and the cost of an insertion by $C_\\iota$. We arbitrarily set both $C_\\delta$ and $C_\\iota$ to 1, but will still reason, design and implement in terms of arbitrary values. The cost of a conversion that involves $n_\\delta$ deletions and $n_\\iota$ insertions is then defined as $n_\\delta C_\\delta+n_\\iota C_\\iota$, so $n_\\delta+n_\\iota$ with our choice of values for $C_\\delta$ and $C_\\iota$. Given a word $w$, denote by $|w|$ the length of $w$. Of course the cost of converting a word $w_1$ into a word $w_2$ is at most equal to $|w_1|C_\\delta+|w_2|C_\\iota$: it suffices to delete all occurrences of characters in $w_1$ and insert all occurrences of characters in $w_2$. It is immediately verified that it is not possible to do any better if and only if $w_1$ and $w_2$ have no common character. We have seen that the cost of converting DEPART into LEOPARD is at most equal to $2C_\\delta+3C_\\iota$, so 5 with our choice of values for $C_\\delta$ and $C_\\iota$, and it is easy to verify that it is impossible to convert DEPART into LEOPARD at a lower cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider a third transformation: *substitution* of an occurrence of a character by an occurrence of another character, with an associated cost of $C_\\varsigma$. Since a deletion and an insertion achieve the same effect as a substitution, it is sensible to set $C_\\varsigma$ to $C_\\delta+C_\\iota$, though other choices are legitimate. So DEPART can be converted into LEOPARD in new ways, still for a cost of 5 if $C_\\delta=1$, $C_\\iota=1$ and $C_\\varsigma=C_\\delta+C_\\iota$, for instance with two substitutions and one insertion:\n",

Taking DEPART and LEOPARD as an example again, and with $C_\\delta=1$, $C_\\iota=1$ and $C_\\varsigma=2$, the Levenshtein distance between both words is 5 and there are 9 such triples, which can conveniently be represented as follows (underscores in the second word are aligned with members of $S_\\delta$, underscores in the first word are aligned with members of $S_\\iota$, and different letters aligned in both words correspond to members of $S_\\varsigma$):\n",
