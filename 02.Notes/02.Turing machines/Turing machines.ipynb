    "A Turing Machine (TM) is an idealised model of a computer. Whereas real computers have finite memory, a TM has infinite memory, represented as a _tape_ of consecutive _cells_, each of which contains either the _symbol_ 0 or the symbol 1, that extends infinitely both left and right. To represent a finite section of the tape of a TM, a particular kind of __object__, namely, a Python __list__, is appropriate. We just need to define a Python list whose elements are the __integers__ 0 and 1, that Python also represents as objects. We can then let a __variable__, say `tape`, denote what the list __literal__ `[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]` itself denotes, namely, a sequence of bits stored in computer memory meant to be interpreted as the Python list that consists of the integers 0, 0, 1, 1, 1 and 0. This is a particular kind of __statement__: an __assignment__. It involves two __expressions__: the list literal and the variable, the list literal itself  involving many occurrences of two expressions: `0` and `1`. Expressions are to be __evaluated__; the result of the evaluation is a mathematical entity, the expression's __value__. Statements are to be __executed__. In the following cell, on the line that precedes the statement `tape = [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]` and on the line of that statement, following it, are two __comments__. When running the cell, `tape = [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]` is executed. Then `tape` is evaluated and a \"standard\" expression is output whose value is the same as `tape`'s value; that expression happens to be the list literal that `tape` has been assigned to:"

    "Now that the program of the TM has been captured in a form that seems appropriate for further use, we can write code to simulate computation. Recall that `tape` represents only a finite section of the tape. As computation progresses, larger and larger sections of the tape are potentially explored, possibly requiring to extend `tape` accordingly, left or right. The widget does this. Here, in order to simplify our task, we assume that `tape` is defined in such a way that it is large enough and contains enough `0`'s at both ends for the head of the TM not to go beyond the section determined by `tape`, for the input under consideration, so there are enough `0`'s left and right of the `1`'s in `tape` that encode the input for all instructions to be executed within `tape`'s boundaries. With this in mind, and knowing how the division by 2 program works, let us set `tape` as follows, so set for an input of 7:"
