# COMP9021 Term 3 2021


'''
Uses data from the American Social Security Administration available
at https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/limits.html.
Splits the data on the relative frequency of given names in the
population of U.S. births into females and males, removing the field
that determines the classification.
The data are stored in a directory "names", in files named "yobxxxx.txt"
with xxxx (the year of birth) ranging from 1880 to 2018.
They will be copied in a directory "names_per_gender", otherwise keeping
the same file structure.
