    "So though Euler's sieve sounded as a good idea and a possible improvement over Eratosthenes' sieve, it turned out to perform much worse because often applying the `remove()` method to a list is not efficient: it is on average linear in the length of the list. But applying the `remove()` method to a set is efficient: it has constant complexity. This suggests to, at every stage when all proper multiples of a (prime) number $p$ have to be eliminated, convert the list of numbers that are still left to a set, remove those multiples from the set, and then convert the resulting set back to a list. Sorting is costly, but being performed only as many times as there are prime numbers smaller than $\\lfloor\\sqrt n\\rfloor$, it could still bring an improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, that allows one to get back to the original idea of eliminating all proper multiples at most equal to $n$ of a given prime number $p$ that are not multiples of smaller prime numbers by multiplying $p$ with all numbers at least equal to $p$ in `sieve`, until the product exceeds $n$. The approach is flawed if numbers are eliminated from `sieve`, but it is valid if numbers are eliminated from a copy of `sieve` as a set. To demonstrate it, we define a new version of `eliminate_proper_multiples_from_set()` that makes use of a `global` __declaration__, a notion that we now introduce.\n",
