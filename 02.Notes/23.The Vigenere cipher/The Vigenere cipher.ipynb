It seems probable that if the key length was 8 rather than 16, then we would have more $n$-grams that reveal vertical alignments over 8 columns than $n$-grams that reveal vertical alignments over 16 columns (actually, not having a single extra factor of 8 strongly suggests that the key length is 16 indeed).
