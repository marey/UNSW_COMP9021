# COMP9021 Term 3 2021


'''
Simulates the Monty Hall problem.
- A car is hidden behind 3 doors.
- The contestant randomly choses a door.
- The game host opens a door behind which there is no car.
- The contestant then has the option to change her mind and open another
  door.

Prompts the user for the number of times the game is played, and whether
the contestant opts for switching door or not.

Displays the details of the game for the few first games, set to a
maximum of 6 by default, and prints out the proportion of games being
won.
