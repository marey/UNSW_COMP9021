    "Let us for a moment get back to $\\mathcal G$ being arbitrary. A natural question is whether, given a finite sequence $\\Lambda$ of terminals, $\\mathcal G$ generates $\\Lambda$. It $\\Lambda$ is empty, then it suffices to check whether $\\mathcal G$'s starting symbol belongs to $\\mathfrak S$. If $\\Lambda$ is not empty, then it is equivalent to ask whether $\\Lambda$ is generated by $\\mathcal G'$. This makes the question easier to answer: if $\\varepsilon$ is present in some production rules of $\\mathcal G$, then a derivation of $\\Lambda$ by $\\mathcal G$ might involve arbitrarily long sequences of symbols, because any symbol in $\\mathfrak S$ can eventually be erased. On the other hand, in any derivation of $\\mathcal G'$, sequences of symbols can only increase in size as the derivation progresses. Since the number of sequences of terminals and nonterminals of a CFG of a given size is finite, the search for a derivation of $\\Lambda$ can be exhaustive and yield a definite outcome in finite time. The search can be reduced to leftmost derivations.\n",

Then one can ask whether $\\mathcal G'$ generates $\\Lambda$ without making use of $\\varepsilon$, which is the same as asking whether $\\mathcal G'$ generates $\\Lambda$, which is equivalent to asking whether $\\mathcal G$ generates $\\Lambda$.\n",

Only pairs where $w_1$ is an initial segment of $\\Lambda$ are \"promising\". The aim is to eventually generate $(\\Lambda, \\varepsilon)$. A set $\\mathfrak A$ keeps track of all promising pairs that have been generated, and a subset $\\mathfrak B$ of $\\mathfrak A$ keeps track of the pairs on which we can further operate. We start with $\\mathfrak A$ and $\\mathfrak B$ containing $(S, \\epsilon)$ only with $S$ denoting $\\mathcal G$'s starting symbol, and we proceed in stages. At any given stage, if $\\mathfrak B$ is empty, then one declares that $\\Lambda$ cannot be generated; otherwise, one gets a pair $(w_1,w_2)$ out of $\\mathfrak B$ and move from the left of $w_2$ to the right of $w_1$ the longest initial segment of $w_2$ consisting of terminals, resulting in a pair $(w'_1,w'_2)$ with $w'_2$ empty or starting with a nonterminal $\\alpha$.\n",

    "* Otherwise, if $w'_2$ is empty, then either $w'_1$ is $\\Lambda$ and known to be generated by $\\mathcal G$ without using $\\varepsilon$ and we are done, or $w'_1$ is not $\\Lambda$ (which is equivalent to $w'_1$ being shorted than $\\Lambda$), so not what we want.\n",
    "* Otherwise, we consider all production rules of $\\mathcal G$ with $\\alpha$ as left hand side and not $\\varepsilon$ as right hand side. For each such rule, we replace in $w'_2$ the occurrence of $\\alpha$ on the left with the rule's right hand side, resulting in a new pair $(w'_1, w''_2)$.\n",

    "The function that follows implements this method. Rather than a set, it uses a list for $\\mathfrak A$, and at every stage, pops its rightmost element, making the method a form of depth-first search. We trace execution with a CFG that generates the palindromes over $\\{a,b\\}$, defined with a little complication to easily witness the case where we process a pair that has been seen already:"

    "Let us organise the whole code in a class `ContextFreeGrammar`, whose `__init()__` method receives as arguments the dictionary capturing the production rules and the starting symbol of $\\mathcal G$. It is natural to let `__init()__` compute once and for all whether $\\mathcal G$ generates the empty sequence, and also compute $\\mathcal G'$. We want `ContextFreeGrammar` to define a method `can_generate_with_no_ε()`, meant to be passed as argument a string of terminal symbols to determine whether $\\mathcal G$ can generate this sequence without making any use of $\\varepsilon$, which is interesting in its own right. We also want `ContextFreeGrammar` to define a method `can_generate()`, meant to be passed as argument a string of terminal symbols to determine whether $\\mathcal G$ generates this sequence, which we know is work for $\\mathcal G'$. This suggests defining another class, `ContextFreeGrammarWithoutε`, able to complete the work required by `ContextFreeGrammar`'s `can_generate()` method, which is precisely what `ContextFreeGrammar`'s `can_generate_with_no_ε()` method does when no production rule involves $\\varepsilon$. Though `ContextFreeGrammarWithoutε` seems to be a more specific type than `ContextFreeGrammar`, it would not be appropriate to let the `__init()__` method of `ContextFreeGrammarWithoutε` compute whether the empty sequence can be generated (the answer is No), nor compute a grammar not involving $\\varepsilon$ and generating the same language (empty sequence included), since `self` could just be returned. So we do not want `ContextFreeGrammarWithoutε`'s `__init()__` method to call `ContextFreeGrammar`'s `__init()__` method. We only want `ContextFreeGrammarWithoutε` to inherit some of `ContextFreeGrammar`'s methods: `__str()__` if that method has been defined to nicely output the grammar's representation, and `can_generate()`, whose implementation should be straightforward and just call `ContextFreeGrammar`'s `can_generate_with_no_ε()` method, so more precisely, overwrite `ContextFreeGrammar`'s implementation of `can_generate()`, which itself essentially calls `ContextFreeGrammarWithoutε`'s `can_generate()` method on the object produced by `__init()__`'s computation of $\\mathcal G'$. This design makes `ContextFreeGrammar` a mixin of `ContextFreeGrammarWithoutε`. The syntax is `class ContextFreeGrammarWithoutε(ContextFreeGrammar)`, but it does not intend to make a `ContextFreeGrammarWithoutε` object a kind of `ContextFreeGrammar` object: rather, it just intends a `ContextFreeGrammarWithoutε` object to make use by inheritance of the `ContextFreeGrammar` methods that make sense to a `ContextFreeGrammarWithoutε` object, such as `can_generate()`, but not of those that are irrelevant, such as `can_generate_with_no_ε()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarise, the key design of `ContextFreeGrammar` and `ContextFreeGrammarWithoutε` is outlined below. The syntax `class ContextFreeGrammarWithoutε(ContextFreeGrammar)` is meant to be read as: `ContextFreeGrammarWithoutε` is a subclass of `object` that can use methods of `ContextFreeGrammar` when appropriate. The fact that `ContextFreeGrammarWithoutε`'s `__init()__` method does not call `ContextFreeGrammar`'s `__init()__` method might be the best formal indicator that `ContextFreeGrammar` is a mixin of `ContextFreeGrammarWithoutε`, not a genuine parent class:"
