Suppose that there is at least one coin in some pile, and let $s$ and $s'$ be the nim sums before and after the player $P$ whose turn it is to play has taken some coins from some nonempty pile, respectively. If $s=0$ then $s'$ is necessarily different to 0. If $s$ is not equal to 0 then $s'=0$ provided that $P$ played as follows. Let $p$ be the position of the leftmost 1 in the binary representation of $s$. Then at least one of $n_1$, ..., $n_k$ has a 1 in its binary representation at position $p$. Let $j\\in\\{1,\\dots,k\\}$ be such that $n_j$ is such a number. Then $n_j\\oplus s$ is smaller than $n_j$, and removing $n_j-(n_j\\oplus s)$ coins from the $j$-th column, that is, leaving $n_j\\oplus s$ coins in the $j$-th column, indeed makes $s'$ equal to 0 (since $s\\oplus n_j$ \"erases\" $n_j$, and so $s'=(s\\oplus n_j)\\oplus(s\\oplus n_j)=0$). The winning strategy can then consist in making such a move, and it can be fixed by letting $j$ be minimal. With the example considered above, $j=2$, and since $n_2\\oplus\\bigoplus_{i=1}^5 n_i=10\\oplus 3=9$, the chosen winning strategy lets the player remove one coin from the second pile.\n"
