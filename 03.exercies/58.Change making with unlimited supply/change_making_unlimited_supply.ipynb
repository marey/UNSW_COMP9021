    "Given a number of face values $v_1$, ..., $v_k$ with $v_1<\\dots<v_k$, an infinite supply of coins for each of those face values, and an integer $x$, we want to get all combinations of coins that amount to $\\$ x$, using the minimal number of coins (there can be no solution, a unique solution, or many solutions). This can be solved using dynamic programming, thanks to an approach that we illustrate for the case where the face values are $\\$1$, $\\$2$, $\\$3$ and $\\$5$ and the desired amount is $\\$9$. The approach consists in creating in one way or another part of the table below, line by line, from top to bottom. The entries in the superdiagonal (that is, the cells at the intersection of the $\\$1$ row and the $\\$1$ column,  at the intersection of the $\\$2$ row and the $\\$2$ column, ...), give the solutions for all amounts between $\\$1$ and $\\$9$:\n",
