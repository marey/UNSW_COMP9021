# Say that two strings s_1 and s_2 can be merged into a third
# string s_3 if s_3 is obtained from s_1 by inserting
# arbitrarily in s_1 the characters in s_2, respecting their
# order. For instance, the two strings ab and cd can be merged
# into abcd, or cabd, or cdab, or acbd, or acdb..., but not into
# adbc nor into cbda.
#
# Prompts the user for 3 strings and displays the output as follows:
# - If no string can be obtained from the other two by merging,
# then the program outputs that there is no solution.
# - Otherwise, the program outputs which of the strings can be obtained
# from the other two by merging.


# Insert your code here
