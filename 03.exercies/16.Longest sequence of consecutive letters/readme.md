Write a program longest_sequence.py that prompts the user for a string w of lowercase letters and outputs the longest sequence of consecutive letters that occur in w, but with possibly other letters in between, starting as close as possible to the beginning of w.

Insert your code into longest_sequence.py.

See more details in the associated Jupyter notebook sheet longest_sequence.ipynb.

If you are stuck, but only when you are stuck, then use longest_sequence_scaffold.py.
