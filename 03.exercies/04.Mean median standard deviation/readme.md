## Mean, median, standard deviation

    Complete the program mean_median_standard_deviation.py that prompts the user for a strictly positive integer, nb_of_elements, generates a list of nb_of_elements random integers between - 50 and 50, prints out the list, computes the mean, the median and the standard deviation in two ways, that is, using or not the functions from the statistics module, and prints them out.

    To compute the median, the easiest way is to first sort the list with the built-in sort() method.

    See commands_and_expected_outputs.txt for expected outputs and sample inputs.
