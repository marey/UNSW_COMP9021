    "Write a program `CO2_emissions.py` that extracts from the file `API_EN.ATM.CO2E.KT_DS2_en_csv_v2_422491.csv`, stored in the subdirectory `API_EN` of the working directory, country levels of $\\mathrm{CO}_2$ emissions for the year 2014. The data will be shown interactively on a map, created as an object of class `World` of the `pygal.maps.world` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can associate to a `World` object a number of  dictionaries whose keys are country codes—check out the `add()` method from the `World` class. We will create two dictionaries with disjoint sets of keys: one for countries whose levels of $\\mathrm{CO}_2$ emissions for the year 2014 can be retrieved from the csv file, and one for countries for which that information is not available, either because there is no record for that country in the csv file, or because the data is missing. The `COUNTRIES` dictionary from the `pygal.maps.world` module maps country names to country codes. The second attribute of the csv file is for country codes, but they are different to `COUNTRIES`'s values. The first attribute of the csv file is for country names; for a few countries, they are different to `COUNTRIES`'s keys. For instance, the country named _Cabo Verde_ in the csv file is named _Cape Verde_ in `COUNTRIES`. These special countries should be identified, so that their level of their $\\mathrm{CO}_2$ emissions, in case it is not missing from the csv file, can be shown on the map.\n",

    "The program will save the `World` object in a file of name `CO2_emissions.svg`—check out the `render_to_file()` method from the `World` class. Besides creating the `CO2_emissions.svg` file, `CO2_emissions.py` will output lines of the form `Leaving out ...` for all records in the csv file that are not for countries in `COUNTRIES`.\n",

    "A version of the `CO2_emissions.svg` file that your program has to create is provided as `CO2_emissions_solution.svg`. As a static image, it displays as shown below. To be able to use the tooltips and see the countries emissions, it is necessary to open `CO2_emissions_solution.svg` in the browser (just drag and drop the file into the address bar of your browser, or provided that files with extension `.svg` are by default associated with your browser, just open the file) but not within Jupyter.\n",
