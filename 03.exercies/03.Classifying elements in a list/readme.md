## Classifying elements in a list

    The operators /, // and % are used for floating point division, integer division, and remainder, respectively.

    Study the program  modulo_4.py and run it in the Terminal window, executing "python3 modulo_4.py". Then complete program intervals.py that prompts the user for a strictly positive integer, nb_of_elements, generates a list of nb_of_elements random integers between 0 and 19, prints out the list, computes the number of elements strictly less than 5, 10, 15 and 20, and prints those out; run it and check your solution with the Run and Mark (or Submit) buttons, respectively.
