It is convenient to use the `deque` class from the `collections` module, to effectively work with a queue, that is, a list of items with items leaving the queue at one end and joining the queue at the other end (with a standard Python list, one operation or the other would have to be of time complexity linear in the size of the list, whereas with a `deque`, both operations have constant time complexity).
