Given a positive integer nn, a magic square of order nn is a matrix of size n \times nn√ón that stores all numbers from 1 up to n^2n 
2
  and such that the sum of the nn rows, the sum of the nn columns, and the sum of the two diagonals is constant, hence equal to n(n^2+1)/2n(n 
2
 +1)/2.

Implement in the file magic_squares.py the function print_square(square), that prints a list of lists that represents a square, and the function is_magic_square(square), that checks whether a list of lists is a magic square.

See the corresponding Jupyter notebook sheet for much more on magic squares.
