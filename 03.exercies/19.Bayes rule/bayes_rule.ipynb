    "We consider 5 dice $\\mathit{die}_1$, ..., $\\mathit{die}_5$ with 4, 6, 8, 12, and 20 faces, respectively. We randomly chose one of $\\mathit{die}_1$, ..., $\\mathit{die}_5$, say $\\mathit{die}$, and cast it again and again.

Denoting by $D$ the event that $n$ is observed as the outcome of the cast, Bayes' rule states that for all $i\\in\\{1,\\dots,5\\}$, $p(H_i)$, the *prior*, is changed to $p(H_i/D)$, the *posterior*, with:\n",
