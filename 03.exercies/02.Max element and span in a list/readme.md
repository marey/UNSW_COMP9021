Max element and span in a list

    Study the program max_in_list.py and run it in the Terminal window, executing "python3 max_in_list.py". Then complete the program span.py that prompts the user for a seed for the random number generator, and for a strictly positive number, nb_of_elements, generates a list of nb_of_elements random integers between 0 and 99, prints out the list, computes the difference between the largest and smallest values in the list without using the builtins min() and max(), prints it out, and check that the result is correct using the builtins; run it and check your solution with the Run and Submit buttons, respectively.
