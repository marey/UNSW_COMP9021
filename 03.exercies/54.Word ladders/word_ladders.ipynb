    "A word ladder is a sequence of words such that two successive words in the sequence differ by exactly one letter; so they start and end with words having the same number of letters. A word ladder is particularly appealing if the first and last words are semantically related. All words that make up a ladder are to be found in a given dictionary. A natural condition is that a ladder is of minimal length (w.r.t. the given dictionary). We are interested in discovering all possible ladders (of minimal length), if any, between given first and last words. For instance, with the dictionary we will be working with, there are 6 ladders of minimal length that transform SUMMER into WINTER. Listed in lexicographic order, they are:\n",
