    "_Proof._$\\ $ The result is trivial if $n=0$, so suppose otherwise. Observe that there are $2n\\choose n$ strings consisting of $n$ Xs and $n$ Ys. Let $w$ be such a string that is not a Dyck word. Then $w$ can be written in a unique way as $a$Y$b$ with $a$ a Dyck word. Then $b$ has one more X than Ys. Let $b'$ be the word obtained from $b$ by changing all Xs to Ys and all Ys to Xs. So $b'$ has one more Y than Xs, hence $a$Y$b'$ consists of $n-1$ Xs and $n+1$ Ys. Conversely, if $w$ is word with $n-1$ Xs and $n+1$ Ys, then $w$ can be written in a unique way as $a$Y$c$ with $a$ a Dyck word and $c$ a word that has one more Y than Xs. If $c'$ is the word obtained from $c$ by changing all Xs to Ys and all Ys to Xs, then $a$Y$c'$ is a Dyck word of length $2n$. So we have established that there exists a one-to-one mapping betweeen the set of strings consisting of $n$ Xs and $n$ Ys that are not Dyck words and the set of strings consisting of $n-1$ Xs and $n+1$ Ys. As the latter is of cardinality $2n\\choose n+1$, we infer that $C_n={2n\\choose n}-{2n\\choose n+1}={2n\\choose n}-\\frac{n}{n+1}{2n\\choose n}=\\frac{1}{n+1}{2n\\choose n}$, as claimed.$\\ $ Q.E.D."
