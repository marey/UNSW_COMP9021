## Decoding a multiplication

    We want to decode all multiplications of the form


    such that the sum of all digits in all 4 columns is constant.

    Insert your code into decoded_multiplication.py. There are actually two solutions, see expected output for details on what it should be. If you are stuck, but only when you are stuck, then use decoded_multiplication_scaffold.py.
