Fibonacci codes
Recall that the Fibonacci sequence (F_n)_{n>=0}(F 
n
​
 ) 
n>=0
​
  is defined by the equations: F_0=0F 
0
​
 =0, F_1=1F 
1
​
 =1 and for all n>0n>0, F_n=F_{n+1}+F_{n-2}F 
n
​
 =F 
n+1
​
 +F 
n−2
​
 .

It can be shown that every strictly positive integer NN can be uniquely coded as a string \sigmaσ of 0's and 1's ending with 1, so of the form b_2b_3\ldots b_kb 
2
​
 b 
3
​
 …b 
k
​
  with k\geq 2k≥2 and b_k=1b 
k
​
 =1, such that NN is the sum of all F_iF 
i
​
 's, 2\leq i\leq k2≤i≤k, with b_i=1b 
i
​
 =1.

For instance, 11=3+8=F_4+F_611=3+8=F 
4
​
 +F 
6
​
 , hence 11 is coded by 00101.

Moreover:

there are no two successive occurrences of 1 in \sigmaσ;

F_kF 
k
​
  is the largest Fibonacci number that fits in NN, and if jj is the largest integer in \{2,\ldots,k-1\}{2,…,k−1} such that b_j=1b 
j
​
 =1 then F_jF 
j
​
  is the largest Fibonacci number that fits in N-F_kN−F 
k
​
 , and if ii is the largest integer in \{2,\ldots,j-1\}{2,…,j−1} such that b_i=1b 
i
​
 =1 then F_iF 
i
​
  is the largest Fibonacci number that fits in N-F_k-F_jN−F 
k
​
 −F 
j
​
 ...

Also, every string of 0's and 1's ending in 1 and having no two successive occurrences of 1's is a code of a strictly positive integer according to this coding scheme. For instance:

There is only one string of 0's and 1's of length 1 ending in 1 and having no two successive occurrences of 1's; it is 1, and it codes 1.

There is only one string of 0's and 1's of length 2 ending in 1 and having no two successive occurrences of 1's; it is 01, and it codes 2.

The strings of 0's and 1's of length 3 ending in 1 and having no two successive occurrences of 1's are 001 and 101 and they code 3 and 4, respectively.

The strings of 0's and 1's of length 4 ending in 1 and having no two successive occurrences of 1's are 0001, 1001 and 0101 and they code 5, 6 and 7, respectively.

The strings of 0's and 1's of length 5 ending in 1 and having no two successive occurrences of 1's are 00001, 10001, 01001, 00101 and 10101 and they code 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12, respectively.

...

The Fibonacci code of NN adds 1 at the end of \sigmaσ; the resulting string then ends in two 1's, therefore marking the end of the code, and allowing one to let one string code a finite sequence of strictly positive integers. For instance, 00101100111011 codes (11,3,4)(11,3,4).

Implement the two functions in the stub, one that takes one argument NN mean to to be a strictly positive integer and returns its Fibonacci code, and one that takes one argument \sigmaσ meant to be a strict consisting 0's and 1's, returns 0 if \sigmaσ cannot be a Fibonacci code, and otherwise returns the integer \sigmaσ is the Fibonacci code of.
