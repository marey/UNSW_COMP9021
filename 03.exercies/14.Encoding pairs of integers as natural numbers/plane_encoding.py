'''
Implements a function encode(a, b) and a function decode(n) for the one-to-one mapping
from the set of pairs of integers onto the set of natural numbers described as follows:

                      16  15  14  13  12
                      17  4   3   2   11
                      18  5   0   1   10
                      19  6   7   8   9
                      20  21  ...

That is, starting from the point (0,0) of the plane, we move to (1,0)
and then spiral counterclockwise.
