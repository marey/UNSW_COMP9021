    "Given a number of face values $v_1$, ..., $v_k$ with $v_1<\\dots<v_k$, $n_1$ coins with face value $\\$v_1$, ..., $n_k$ coins with face value $\\$v_k$, and a positive integer $x$, we want to get all combinations of available coins that amount to $\\$ x$ using the minimal number of coins (there can be no solution, a unique solution, or many solutions).\n",

    "It is not possible to adapt the dynamic programming technique that solves the particular case where $v_1$, ..., $v_k$ are all infinite to the finite case. For instance, suppose that the possible face values are $\\$2$, $\\$3$, $\\$5$, $\\$10$, $\\$14$ and $\\$16$, and for each of those face values there is exactly one coin available. Let the desired amount be $\\$20$. There is a unique solution: it consists of the $\\$2$, $\\$3$, $\\$5$ and $\\$10$ coins. Using dynamic programming, one would try and add $\\$2$ to a best solution to $\\$18$, or add $\\$3$ to a best solution to $\\$17$, or add $\\$5$ to a best solution to $\\$10$, or add $\\$10$ to a best solution to $\\$10$.
