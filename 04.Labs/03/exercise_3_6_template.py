# Assume that the argument L is a list of lists of integers
# that are all of the same length, say a strictly positive
# integer n, and that fields is a list that represents a
# permutation of {1, ..., n}.
#
# L has to be sorted considering in a list L' of length n
# - first the element of L' whose position is given by the
#   first member of fields,
# - if n >= 2, then the element of L' whose position is given by the
#   second member of fields,
# - ...
# - finally, the element of L' whose position is given by the
#   last member of fields.
